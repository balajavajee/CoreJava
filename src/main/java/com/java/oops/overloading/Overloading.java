	// 1. Two methods are said to be overloaded if and only if both methods have same name but different argument types.

	// 2. In C, method overloading concept is not available. Hence, we can't declare multiple methods with same name but
	// different args types. If there is change in argument type compulsory we should go for new method name which
	// increases complexity of programming.

	// 3. In Java, we can declare multiple methods with same name but different arguments types, such types of methods
	// are called overloaded methods.
	
	// 4. Having overloading concept in java reduces complexity of programming.
