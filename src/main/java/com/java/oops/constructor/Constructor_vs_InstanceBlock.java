{
	// 1. The main purpose of constructor is to perform initialization of an object but other than initialization if we
	// want to perform any activity for every object creation then we should go for instance block (like updating entry
	// in database for every object creation or incrementing counter for every object creation, etc).

	// 2. Both constructor and instance block have their own different purposes and replacing one concept with another
	// concept may not work always.
