A Java program can contain any number of classes but at-most one class can be declared as public.

If there's a public class then name of the program and the name of the public class must be matched otherwise we'll get
compile time error.

Example 1:
class A
{
}
class B
{
}
class C
{
}

Case 1: 
If there's no public class then we can use any name and there are no restrictions. Program name can be:
A.java
B.java
C.java
Test.java

Case 2:
If class B is public then name of the program should be B.java otherwise we'll get compile time error saying
class B is public, should be declared in a file named B.java


Case 3:
if class B and class C declared as public and name of the program is B.java then we'll get compile time error saying
class C is public, should be declared in a file named C.java

Example 2:
class A
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("A class main");
	}
}
class B
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("B class main");
	}
}
class C
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("C class main");
	}
}
class D
{
}

Save this file name as Test.java

Now if we compile, javac Test.java, 4 class files will be created i.e. A.class, B.class, C.class and D.class

cmd > java A
Output: A class main

cmd > java B
Output: B class main

cmd > java C
Output: C class main

cmd > java D
Output: RE: NoSuchMethodError: main

cmd > java Test
Output: RE: NoClassDefFoundError: Test

Note: Program name is used to compile a program i.e. Test.java and to run a program, class name is used i.e. java A, java B, java C
and java D

Conclusions:
1. Whenever we're compiling a java program for every class present in that program a separate .class file will be generated.

2. We can compile a java program (source file) but we can run a java .class file.

3. Whenever we're executing a java class, the corresponding class main() will be executed. If class doesn't contain main() then we'll
	get runtime exception saying NoSuchMethodError: main.
	
4. If corresponding .class file not available then we'll get runtime exception saying NoClassDefFoundError: ClassName

5. It's not recommended to declare multiple classes in a single source file, it's highly recommended to declare only one class 
	per source file and name of the program will be same as class name. The main advantage of this approach is readability and
	maintainability of the code will be improved.
